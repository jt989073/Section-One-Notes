## Steps for solving Matrix graphs

1. identify that it is a matrix graph
    - What is the problem asking you to do?
    - What does the matrix represent?
    - What does each node represent?
    - What relationship do the edges represent?
    - What is considered a valid neighbor, in the context of this problem?
    - Is this a search or traversal problem?
    - Does this require a depth-first or breadth-first approach?

2. Get Neighbors
3. Traverse the graph and do the thing
