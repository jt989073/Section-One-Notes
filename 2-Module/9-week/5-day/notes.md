## Memory - What the h\*ck is it?
## RAM
- What does it hold?
  - bits, 1s and 0s, in the form of electrical charge
- Is it slow or fast?
  - fast, to read and write
- Persistent or volatile?
  - volatile - HDDs and SSDs are for long-term storage
  - needs a constant electric power source to retain information
- Cheap or expensive compared to hard disk storage?
  - expensive
- How do we access or refer to it?
  - memory addresses, pointers, references



#### Only two kinds of things are truly stored in memory
  - Instructions
  - Raw data









## Pointers, references, etc
- What do 16/32/64-bit even mean?
  - 0000000000
  - 1111111111
- How much space is needed to store an address/reference/pointer on a 16/32/64-bit system?
- What is a variable?
- What is an array?
- What is a stack?
  - Like an array, but...
  - Things can only be added to or removed from the top
- Let's "zoom out" on Node
