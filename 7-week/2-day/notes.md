# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming, introduced by Robert C. Martin. It states that a class or module should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

## Benefits of SRP
- **Code Organization**: SRP promotes better organization of code by keeping each responsibility separate. This makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

- **Reusability**: When a class or function has a single responsibility, it becomes more reusable in different parts of the application.

- **Testability**: Code that follows SRP is easier to test because each unit has a clear and focused purpose.


# Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
DRY, also known as the DRY principle, is a software development principle that promotes code reusability and maintainability. It suggests that duplication in logic or functionality should be avoided by abstracting common functionality into a single, reusable component.

## Benefits of DRY

- **Reduced Code**: By eliminating duplication, the codebase becomes smaller and more concise.

- **Maintenance**: Changes or bug fixes need to be applied in one place only, reducing the chances of errors due to inconsistent code.

- **Consistency**: DRY encourages consistent implementations, making the code easier to understand and follow.
