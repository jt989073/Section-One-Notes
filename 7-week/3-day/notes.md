What is a class?

- A class is a template/blueprint for creating objects
- A instance of a class is an object with all the properties and methods defined
  on the class
- Some of our favorite datatypes such as Array, and Object are classes. For
  example the method `someArray.forEach()` is callable in this way because it is
  an instance method defined on the class `Array`.
  - [Array Constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array)
  - Notice how you can create an array using the `new` keyword

Why does OOP use Classes?

- Classes are a clean way to `Encapsulate` your code. They provide an API
  that hides the internal complexity(logic) and manages the data of your object
  - Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal implementation details of a class from the outside world, allowing you to control access to the class's properties and methods. This way, you can protect the data and ensure that it is manipulated only through predefined methods, reducing the risk of unintended interference and making the code more maintainable and robust.
- Classes allow us to model real world entities in an organized way which can
  make solving certain types of problems easier

```js
// Define a class with the class keyword followed by the name with the first
// letter capital and the rest of the words camel case
class Taco {
  // constructor is invoked when you create a new class such as:
  // new Taco("chicken", ["sour cream", "cheese"])
  constructor(meat, toppings = []) {
    // define any instance variables or logic that needs to be run when an
    // instance of the class is created
    this.meat = meat
    this.toppings = toppings
    this.tortillaType = 'corn'
  }
  // instance method
  assemble() {
    return `These are some delicious ${this.meat} tacos on a ${
      this.tortillaType
    } tortilla with all the toppings ${this.toppings.join(', ')}.`
  }
}
// create a instance of a Taco and store in a variable
const carnitasTaco = new Taco('carnitas', ['guacamole', 'salsa'])
// call an instance method
console.log(carnitasTaco.assemble())
```


### Inheritence 

```js
class Instrument {
  constructor(name, family) {
    this.name = name;
    this.family = family;
  }

  play() {
    console.log('toot toot toot');
  }
}
  class Guitar extends Instrument {
    constructor() {
      Guitar.total += 1;
      super(`Guitar ${Guitar.total}`, 'Strings');
    }
  
    static total = 0;
  
    strumGuitar() {
      console.log('strumming guitar');
    }
    
  }

class Trumpet extends Instrument {
  constructor() {
    Trumpet.total += 1;
    super(`Trumpet ${Trumpet.total}`, 'Brass');
  }

  static total = 0;

  releaseSpitValve() {
    console.log('releasing spit valve');
  }
}


// What will print to the console?
const jamesGuitar = new Guitar();
const jamesTrumpet = new Trumpet();
jamesGuitar.play();
jamesTrumpet.play();
jamesGuitar.strumGuitar();
jamesTrumpet.releaseSpitValve();

/* 
We all know that guitars make more of a guitar sound lol
How can I change just the guitar to shringggg instead of toot?
*/
