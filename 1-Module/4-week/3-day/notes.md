## Scope

### `Overview`

- What is scope?

  - Scope determines what variables are available for use within any given line
    of a JavaScript program.

- Advantages of Using Scope Correctly

  - `Security` - Restricting variables to only predefined sections of a program.
  - `Avoiding Namespace Collisions` - Allows you to reuse variables
    names in different scopes without causing errors.

- Three types of scope

  - `Global` - Variables defined in the global scope.
    - Everything in js is an object. When running js in the browser the global
      scope represents the window when running js locally (Node) it represents the
      global object.
    - If you initialize a variable without a declaration it defaults to the
      global scope.
  - `Local or Function` - Global, Parameters, Variables in the function
  - `Block`- Global, Local, Variables in the block

```js

let globalScope = 'I am globally scoped'

let myFunction = function(functionScope){
  let alsoFunctionScope = "I am also function scoped"

  if(!functionScope){
    let blockScope = 'I am block scoped"
  };
};

myFunction("I am function scoped");

```

---

```js
let car = "vroom";
function makeSounds(dogSound) {
  let cow = "moo";

  if (true) {
    let turkey = "gobble";

    for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
      console.log(car, dogSound, cow, turkey, i);
    }
  }
}
makeSounds("woof");
```

- Scope Chaining

  - JS will search through scopes, working upwards until it finds a match.
    - Inner scopes have access to outer scopes but outer scopes don't have
      access to inner scopes

```js
let hungry = false;

function sayHungry() {
  let hungry = true;
  if (hungry) {
    console.log("I'm hungry!");
  } else {
    console.log("I'm coding");
  }
}

sayHungry();
```

### `Let, Const, and Var`

- `Let` is block scoped and CAN be reassigned.
- `Const` is also block scoped, but CANNOT be reassigned.
- reassign !== mutable
- `Var` is function scoped, and CAN be reassigned.
- `Temporal Dead Zone` The state where variables are un-reachable. They are in scope, but they aren't declared, and or initialized.

|       | declaration | assignment  |  initialization  |  scope   |        hoisting        |
| :---: | :---------: | :---------: | :--------------: | :------: | :--------------------: |
|  var  |   var x;    | x = 'Toby'; |  var x = 'Tom';  | function | declared; not assigned |
|  let  |   let x;    | x = 'Toby'; |  let x = 'Tom';  |  block   |   Temporal Dead Zone   |
| const |             |             | const x = 'Tom'; |  block   |   Temporal Dead Zone   |
