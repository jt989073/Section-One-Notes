## Semantic HTML

Why can't we just use a div?

- Accessibility

  - For the disabled
  - For Search Engine Optimization(SEO)
  - For the developer

Is it more important for the style to match the tag or the function?

- This can be debated, but generally for SEO you should have the tag follow the
  function

## Wireframing

- The practice of mapping out your sites content before actually coding
- In a professional workspace this is going to be done for you by a designer
- A great tool for getting your ideas out before you write a bunch of code
