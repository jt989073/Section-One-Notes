## Middleware

Express is "essentially a series of middleware function calls"

## What is Middleware?

Conceptually: any code that runs between receiving a request and sending back the response

By Definition: any function that takes in `req`, `res`, and `next` as arguments

## How does Middleware work?

Express operates as a stack of middleware functions. It will execute these functions in order upon receiving a request, and stops executing once a response is sent back.

We can add layers to the middleware stack by creating our own middleware functions.

```js
// since this takes req, res, and next, it's an Express Middleware!

const myMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("I'm a middleware function!");
  next();
};
```

To get Express to use this function, we can pass it directly to a route handler

```js
app.get('/', myMiddleware);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    // handling the request
})

// we can also continue to handle the request within the same handler

app.get('/', myMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  // Handling of the request
});
```

We can also pass it to `app.use()`. Anytime you've passed something to `app.use()`, you were adding a layer to the Express Middleware Stack! These are all examples of using middleware

```js
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.static('/catPhotos'));
app.use(myMiddleware);
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.body);
  next();
});
```

Anything you pass to `app.use()` will get called **_every time_** a request is made.

If it's a built-in middleware (`express.json()`), then you don't have to worry about calling `next()`, it's already being done for you. If you are making your own middleware function, you **_must_** call `next()`

## next()

Calling `next()` will tell express to "return" out of our current function and run the next **_applicable_** function.

```js
const mid1 = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Hey I'm mid1!");
  next();
};

const mid2 = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Hey I'm mid2!!");
  // next(); if next is called we would need another middleware to handle sending the request
  res.send('This is the / response')
};

app.get('/', mid1, mid2);
```

When making a GET request to `/`

```md
# console will print

Hey I'm mid1!
Hey I'm mid2!!
```

Similarly

```js
const myMid = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Hey look I'm printing!");
  next();
};

app.get('/', myMid);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Wow I printed after myMid!');
  res.send('This is the / response');
});
```

```md
# console will print

Hey look I'm printing!
Wow I printed after myMid!!

# browser will display

This is the / response
```

We can have more than one route handler for each route, and if the first one calls `next()`, the next route handler will be called. This can be chained as many times as we want.

However if the route pattern is not matched, it will be skipped!

```js
const myMid = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Hey look I'm printing!");
  next();
};

const missedMid = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('I never get to print :(');
  next();
};

app.get('/', myMid);

app.get('/hello', missedMid);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  console.log('I still get to print!');
  res.send('This is the / response');
});
```

When making a GET request to `/`

```md
# console will print

Hey look I'm printing!
I still get to print!

# browser will display

This is the / response
```

But, if we make a GET request to `/hello`

```md
# console will print

I never get to print :(

# browser will display

Cannot GET /hello

# because we don't res.send() anything from /hello
```

# Error Handling Middleware

Express handles errors through middleware. There are default Development and Production environment errors

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  throw Error();
});

// Development Environment - node app.js
Error
  at ... (Crazy Stack Trace)

// Production Environment - NODE_ENV=production node app.js
"Internal Server Error"
```

This functionality exists to give the developer a detailed error output so the problem can easily be debugged, and to ensure that a user doesn't see any unnecessary information when something goes wrong.

Although the default may work well, it's very useful to set our own error handlers.

## How to use error handling middleware

Error handling middleware _MUST_ have 4 parameters, `err`, `res`, `req`, and `next`, and `err` _NEEDS_ to be the first parameter. This is the only way for Express to recognize something as error handling middleware.

Just like with any other custom middleware, we pass our error handlers into `app.use()` so it can be ran on every request. Error handler should be defined after all other middleware and route handlers.

```js
app.use(express.json())
app.use(myMiddleware)

app.get(...)

app.get(...)

app.post(...)

app.delete(...)


// this is bad because they are named incorrectly by order order is always error, request, response, next
// app.use((req, res, next, err) => {
  // -------- req is actually error, res is actually req, next is actually res, err is actually next ---------- // 
//   console.log(err)
//   res.status(err.status || 500)
//   res.send('Whoops! Some error happened I guess?')
// })

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log(err)
  res.status(err.status || 500)
  res.send('Whoops! Some error happened I guess?')
})
```

## What a/A DOESN'T want you to know!?! ðŸ˜³ ðŸ˜± ðŸ¤«

There is a very important difference between an **_error being thrown_** and an **_error being handled_**

Notice that simply hitting a route that doesn't exist **_does not_** throw an error, instead "Cannot get /urlPath" is sent to the browser. Adding in an error handler does not change that functionality

```js
app.get('/hi', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hi there!');
});

// This is an error handler
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.send('Error: Never got to say hi :( ');
});
```

Making a GET to `/hello`

```md
Cannot GET /hello
```

One more time: **Having An Error Handler Does Not Throw An Error**

If we want our error handler to actually handle something, we have to manually throw an error (provided you don't have broken code). To throw an error, we create a regular middleware function and pass it to `app.use()` at the bottom of our other middleware, but before our error handling middleware.

```js
app.get('/hi', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hi there!');
  // console.log('something')
});

// This is throwing the error (notice no 'err' parameter)
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // const err = new Error("We didn't find that resource");
  // err.statusCode = 404
  // next(err)
  throw new Error('we didnt find that resource')
});

// This is an error handler
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log(err.message);
  res.send('Error: Never got to say hi :( ');
});
```

It is very important you don't pass 'err' to your error thrower! Express will never see that handler if you do.

Express reads the file from top to bottom and applies this middleware checklist:

1. Run any middleware that should run every time (e.g. `express.json()`)
2. Run any route handlers that match the request
3. If .send/.json is called, send the response. If next is called, run the next standard middleware
4. If an error is thrown or next is called with an error passed in, run the next error middleware
5. Restart from step 3 until a response is sent

The key here is standard vs error middleware. Express will only ever use standard middleware until an error is thrown. From there, error middleware is used as long as next is called with an error - `next(err)`. If next is called normally, the next standard middleware is called, including route handlers.


```js
app.get('/hi', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hi there!');
});

// This is throwing the error (notice no 'err' parameter)
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const myErr = new Error("We didn't find that resource");
  next(myErr)
});

// This is an error handler
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.log(err.message); // We didn't find that resource // this comes from error handler above
  res.send('Error: Never got to say hi :( ');
});
```

## Express Router

Express Routers allow us to direct traffic into different parts of our application. This enables us to have a more organized file structure, making it much easier to develop and maintain. Instead of all requests being handled in app.js, we can handle user requests in user.js, dog requests in dog.js, and so on.

Express Router is available through Express, no extra install required. We must remember to export our router and the bottom of the file so we can import it into app.js

```js
// a file that is not app.js
const express = require('express');

const router = express.Router();

/* Routing code goes here */

module.exports = router;
```

Routers are commonly stored in a "routes" folder. Within that folder you create a file to handle your routes. To create a route, do as we normally would with app.methodName(), but use router instead.

```js
// routes/eldenRing.js

// url: localhost:5000/eldenRing
router.get('/', (req, res) => {});

// url: localhost:5000/eldenRing/Greatsword
router.post('/:weapon', (req, res) => {});
```

Finally, in app.js, we import our routers and `app.use()` them. The syntax is similar to `express.static()`, the first argument is the url path the user should type into the browser, the second is the router we've created.

```js
// app.js
const express = require('express');

const eldenRing = require('./routes/eldenRing');

const app = express();

app.use('/eldenRing', eldenRing);
```

Just like with `express.static()`, the url path Does Not have to match the file we're routing from. It's simply the convention and tends to be easier to work with.

```js
// same app.js

app.use('/bestGameEver', eldenRing);
```
